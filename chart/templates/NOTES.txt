1. See the documentations and examples:

URL: https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/tree/main/docs/examples

2. For minimal example CR for create rabbitmq deployment "Hello World Example"

Create the file rabbitmq.yaml 

apiVersion: rabbitmq.com/v1beta1
kind: RabbitmqCluster
metadata:
  name: hello-world

and apply 

$ kubectl apply -f rabbitmq.yaml

And once deployed, you can check what defaults were applied like this (spec section is the most important):

kubectl get -o yaml rabbitmqclusters.rabbitmq.com hello-world
